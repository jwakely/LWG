<p>
The following use of `std::ranges::for_each` is valid before <paper num="P2609R3"/> and invalid after that.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ranges&gt;
#include &lt;tuple&gt;
using namespace std::ranges;

void f() {
  int a[1];
  auto fun = [](auto t) {
    [[maybe_unused]] auto x = std::get&lt;int&amp;&gt;(t);
  };
  for_each(views::zip(a), fun);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The reason is that, <paper num="P2609R3"/> requires `fun` to be `invocable` with <tt>iter_value_t&lt;I&gt;&amp;</tt>, 
which is <tt>tuple&lt;int&gt;&amp;</tt> when `I` is `zip_view`'s iterator, and <tt>tuple&lt;int&gt;&amp;</tt> 
doesn't support <tt>std::get&lt;int&amp;&gt;(t)</tt> because there isn't a <tt>int&amp;</tt> member.
<p/>
P2609R3 argues that "The actual consequence on user code seems small", but I believe that this code pattern is 
common enough, and it hurts if we cannot use <tt>get&lt;int&amp;&gt;(t)</tt> in the lambda body.
<p/>
Note that `for_each` doesn't actually call `fun` with <tt>iter_value_t&lt;I&gt;</tt>, as can be seen by adding 
an explicit return type to `fun`.
<p/>
Did LWG foresee this impact of <paper num="P2609R3"/>? Could P2609R3 be reverted to unbreak this code pattern?
